Haskell
=======

Notes
-----
* Doesn't take a command line argument yet
* Can be run in the interactive interpreter (slow) using `ghci fib.hs`
* Or can be compiled (slow) using `ghc fib.hs` and then `./fib`
* Can be optimized with `-O`, `-O2` or `-Odph`.  `-Odph` seems fastest.
  DPH stands for Data Parallel Haskell.

To do
-----
* Take arguments from command line
* Add to `test.sh`
